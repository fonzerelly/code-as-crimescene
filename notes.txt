from Pragmatic Book Shelf
Author: Adam Tornhill

iCrimes have offenders
to find offenders forensic psyc could be used
code can be an offender to a system
to find offenders wer minin g commit data and anlyse version history
crimes


overivew
find hotspots next crime will prob happen
detect architectual decay
code churn(rate at wich code evolves)

Crimes in term of code
changing code takes to long
changing code introduces bugs

prdedict new crimes
find hotsposts

Static code analysis

iwhats hot?


use data from vcs
who changed wich file when
how often
focusing on acertain perioad
use color to highlicht frequency

creating an offender profile
code Maat free
collect data from vcs and inspect it with codemaat

resulting logfile
who what when

Measurement: Change frequency
Analyze Change frequency

research has shown: frequent changes to complex code indicats declining

limitations
data is not normalized
depends on analysis perios
depends on comit styles

Uncover hidden dependencies

analysze coupliibng
no explicit cupling

Cupling - is there a design problem

look into source code to infestigate
git log

sum of cupbling
the metric gives number of shared transactions for a module
gives a priority
